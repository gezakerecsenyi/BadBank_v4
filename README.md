## How to use
 - Ensure that you have `mongod` installed locally
 - Start up a Mongo instance running on the default location (this is easiest to do through MongoDB Compass - if you install the app and ensure it's added to `path`, you should be good to go).
 - Start the server using `npm run start-server`
 - Start the client using `npm run start`
